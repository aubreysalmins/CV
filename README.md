## Aubrey Salmins

I am currently enrolled at Makers Academy (London), one of the most prestigious coding bootcamps in Europe. With a rigorous curriculum and a focus on hands-on, project-based learning, Makers Academy offers an unparalleled educational experience that prepares students for the challenges of the tech industry. 

My brother who is a senior dev sparked my passion for coding and has been invaluable during my journey to become a developer. With his mentorship and my own self-directed learning, I have gained foundational knowledge in several programming languages.

## Education

I decided not to go to university because I wanted to explore music. I spend time self-studying and in apprenticeships while working to support the launch of a career. When that side of my personality was satisfied I decided it was time to pursue a more analytical path in technology. 

At A-level, I attained an A in Greek and B grades in German and English.


## Skills

#### Soft Skills

I am a natural problem solver and I have an ability to grasp abstract concepts and complex systems. The prospect of being able to apply these skills daily in a career is exciting. 

I possess strong leadership, team management, organizational, and communication skills, along with a keen sense of empathy. These skills have been honed through my extensive experience in the hospitality industry, including managing a cafe in a new business. They are highly transferable to the tech industry, where effective collaboration and communication are essential for success.

#### Languages

Greek (Fluent), French & German (Conversational)

## Interests

My passions include art and music, sports, complex biological systems such as neurobiology and endocrinology, philosophy, and travel. I find it fascinating investigating the intersections between these fields.
