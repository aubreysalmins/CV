I am currently enrolled at Makers Academy (London), one of the most prestigious coding bootcamps in Europe. With a rigorous curriculum and a focus on hands-on, project-based learning, Makers Academy offers an unparalleled educational experience that prepares students for the challenges of the tech industry. 

My brother who is a senior dev sparked my passion for coding and has been invaluable during my journey to become a developer. With his mentorship and my own self-directed learning, I have gained foundational knowledge in several programming languages.
